# Programming Black Assignemnt 2 Logs
wcqg59 - Muhammad Azam Bin Aminuddin

## Introduction
As a collaborative project for the 2nd Programming Black Assignment, me and a few other students have chosen to use our project buidling a self-trailing autonomous shopping cart within the Robotics society as our subject. 

Admittedly, although the project idea itself and groups have already been initialised very early on in the year, not much has been done as groundwork and hard coding. This assignemnet will be the oppurtunity to focus and learn about what entails in a robotics project from concept to final product (Though reaching the final stage is a huge ambition!)

### Project outline
I have segmented the overall project and assignment as 3 main goals/core values. 

1. **Maintain ambition to reach a final product.** This includes not being enclosed in feasibility, rather focusing on solutions to general and future issues and processes.

    This would allow for the oppurtunity to tackle more aspects in the whole process of product creation rather than being road blocked by an early issue.

2. **Investigate the not so computer science aspects of robot creation.** As one of the few students who had selected an engineering module as the optional module for 1st year, I would also keep in mind the engineering physical trials and how it would be solved using the programs we would have to create.

3. **Exploration of other projects.** Though not particalry inspired by a certain past project by other people, I have no doubt the problems we will face have been discovered and solved by others before, in similar or completely different projects of their own. 

    I wish to explore and research what could be applicable for our case, as what better solution is there to a problem than a tested solution in which you can gauge success?
